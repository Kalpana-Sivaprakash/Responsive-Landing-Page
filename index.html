                <p> I'm a junior Web developer with good knowledge of front end techniques and passionate about creating interactive applications. From Non-IT background to code on a web page, I love the structure and order and I also stand for quality. I love spending time on fixing little details and optimizing web apps. Also i like working in a team, would learn faster and much more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I've always been drawn to both the creative and analytical side of development, I'm so thankful to be able to do both with the foundation I built during bootcamp.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm excited to make the leap and continue refining my skills with the right company. I'm now looking for a junior dev position to finally kick start my career and learn among professionals.

                <p> I have done front-end bootcamp course from where I gained a strong foundation in software development principles. I have done 2 major projects. The first one is Travel buddy which will display weather forecast, local area news, and exchange rates value in accordance with selected location through third-party APIs with Ajax call. And the second one is Chill corner , a musical web application which is integrated with Spotify api and aimed at delivering personalized environment for studying or relaxing by selecting theme with background music and images. Both the projects were deployed in my GitHub repo and available for public view.
